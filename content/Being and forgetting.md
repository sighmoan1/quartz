title: Being and forgetting

Heidegger tried to write being and time, and failed.

Sartre ripped him off, and wrote being and nothingness which is somewhat insightful but also long and boring.

Someone should write "Being and Memory", because our context is defined by our memories, and English only has two tenses past and present. This would let us have a bit of a go at V. H. Dudman and all that jazz. Plus, memory seems key to what PTSD is.

Being-towards-death. Shit nazi idea. Justin Sledge is right to reject this. When we are living them, our lives aren't defined by the ending, they are defined by the beginning - where we've come from. If they were defined by where we are going - guess what - we're all going to the same place; undifferentiated dead cunts.

Being and forgetting: what is it that we're doing here again?
